# Agent Guidelines

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Expectations
- **Do not be lazy.** If a task needs verification, check the code and confirm assumptions with evidence.
- **Always test your work. Always.** Run at least one relevant automated test or check for every change, and report the exact command.
- **Update the progress log on every change.** Add an entry to `PROGRESS_LOG.md` describing what you changed and why.
- Keep changes small, focused, and well-documented.

## Progress Log Format
Each entry in `PROGRESS_LOG.md` should include:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Summary of changes
- Tests run (include command)
