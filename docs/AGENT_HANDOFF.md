Date: 2026-01-30
Agent: Codex
Goal (1 sentence): Create a canonical project document to preserve the product vision and update continuity docs.

## What I changed
- Summary: Added CANON.md and logged the decision, plus updated continuity docs.

## Files touched
- CANON.md — new canonical product and UX constitution.
- docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md — Decision Log entry for CANON.md.
- PROGRESS_LOG.md — session entry.
- docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md — updated handoff.

## Commands run
- ls
- cat AGENTS.md
- cat docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md
- cat PROGRESS_LOG.md
- cat docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md

## Notes / gotchas
- No tests run (per request).

## Next steps
- [ ] Review CANON.md for accuracy and adjust wording as needed.
- [ ] Continue P0 stabilization work once the canon is approved.
