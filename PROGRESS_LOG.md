# Progress Log

# PROGRESS_LOG — ShopApp1

Running “what happened / what next” log.
Agents MUST update this at the end of every session.

## Current Priorities (P0 → P3)

### P0 — Platform Stability
- Auth/session reliability (single approach, consistent guards)
- App shell reliability (providers, CSS, layout stability)
- Mobile nav + core shell usability

### P1 — UX + Core Flows
- Orders page redesign (clean, usable, fast)
- Time tracking that supports stop/switch/resume without inflating time

### P2 — Modularization
- Migrate domain logic out of src/lib/* into src/modules/*
- Enforce “repo/service/ui/schema” boundaries
- Establish consistent patterns for validation and data access

### P3 — Expansion
- Reporting/export, attachments, and other add‑ons as needed

## Latest Status

### Repo state summary
- Next.js App Router
- Prisma database layer
- shadcn/tailwind UI
- Auth utilities exist in src/lib/auth.ts
- Domain logic exists in src/lib/* (orders/quotes/etc.) but needs module boundaries

### Important domain note (do not regress)
- Labor and Addon charges are already enforced as per‑part (partId required for LABOR/ADDON).
- Order‑level charges are still allowed for non‑labor/addon kinds (e.g., shipping/fees/discounts) by design.

## Session Log (append newest at top)

### 2026-01-28 — Architecture map + continuity docs alignment
- Reviewed current app shell, domains, data flow, and charge model to establish a repo-backed architecture map.
- Documented boundary violations and a plan-only Orders module extraction list (no code changes).
- Added docs/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md and created docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md and docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md (docs were missing in /docs).

Next steps (immediate)
- Decide whether to deprecate/remove root AGENT_CONTEXT.md and AGENTS_HANDOFF.md now that docs/ copies exist.
- Begin Orders module extraction planning with repo/service/schema split.

### 2026-01-28 — Continuity spine created + corrected charge note
- Added AGENTS.md (agent charter + architecture rules)
- Added docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md (priorities + invariants + decision log)
- Added docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md (handoff template)
- Clarified that LABOR/ADDON are already per‑part; only other charge kinds may be order‑level

Next steps (immediate)
- Confirm desired UX direction for Orders page (hierarchy, what fields matter)
- Decide initial module split: Orders / Quotes / Customers / Time
- Begin “architecture lock” (file moves + boundary enforcement) without changing functionality

## Upcoming Work Queue (short list)

- [ ] Create src/modules/* structure and migrate one domain (Orders) first
- [ ] Standardize server-side data access pattern (repo/service)
- [ ] Standardize validation entry points (zod schemas in module)
- [ ] Establish mobile-first app shell nav pattern and apply across key pages
- [ ] Implement time tracking model (TimeEntry, active timer constraints)
