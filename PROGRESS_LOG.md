# Progress Log

# PROGRESS_LOG — ShopApp1

Running “what happened / what next” log.
Agents MUST update this at the end of every session.

## Current Priorities (P0 → P3)

### P0 — Platform Stability
- Auth/session reliability (single approach, consistent guards)
- App shell reliability (providers, CSS, layout stability)
- Mobile nav + core shell usability

### P1 — UX + Core Flows
- Orders page redesign (clean, usable, fast)
- Time tracking that supports stop/switch/resume without inflating time

### P2 — Modularization
- Migrate domain logic out of src/lib/* into src/modules/*
- Enforce “repo/service/ui/schema” boundaries
- Establish consistent patterns for validation and data access

### P3 — Expansion
- Reporting/export, attachments, and other add‑ons as needed

## Latest Status

### Repo state summary
- Next.js App Router
- Prisma database layer
- shadcn/tailwind UI
- Auth utilities exist in src/lib/auth.ts
- Domain logic exists in src/lib/* (orders/quotes/etc.) but needs module boundaries

### Important domain note (do not regress)
- Labor and Addon charges are already enforced as per‑part (partId required for LABOR/ADDON).
- Order‑level charges are still allowed for non‑labor/addon kinds (e.g., shipping/fees/discounts) by design.

## Session Log (append newest at top)

### 2026-01-30 — Prompt A Step 3-5 auth guard alignment
- Standardized admin checks in middleware and whoami to use shared RBAC helper for consistent session-based admin evaluation.
- Reviewed layout/providers for duplication; no changes needed.

Tests run:
- Not run (not requested).

### 2026-01-30 — Add roadmap and mechanical agent prompts
- Added ROADMAP.md with gate-based phases and exit criteria.
- Added AGENT_PROMPTS.md with strict, rule-driven agent instructions.
- Logged the decision in docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md.
- Updated handoff notes for continuity.

Tests run:
- Not run (not requested).

### 2026-01-30 — Add canonical project document
- Created CANON.md to define the product purpose, mental model, UX principles, and roadmap.
- Logged the new canon file in the Decision Log to prevent context drift.
- Updated handoff notes for continuity.

Tests run:
- Not run (per request).

### 2026-01-29 — Fix middleware response status typing
- Updated middleware to set status via NextResponse.rewrite init to satisfy read-only typing.
- Build now advances past middleware but fails in Orders assign route type narrowing (not modified).

Tests run:
- `npm run build` (failed: src/app/api/orders/[id]/assign/route.ts ServiceResult .data typing)

### 2026-01-29 — Regenerated Prisma client for build
- Ran `npx prisma generate` to fix the missing Prisma client artifacts.
- Build now progresses further but fails due to a TypeScript error in middleware (no changes made per constraints).

Tests run:
- `npx prisma generate`
- `npm run build` (failed: middleware.ts type error assigning to read-only status)

### 2026-01-29 — Mark quotes routes server-only
- Added `server-only` imports to all Quotes API routes.
- Re-ran build; failure persists due to missing Prisma client browser artifacts in this environment.

Tests run:
- `npm run build` (failed: Module not found: Can't resolve '.prisma/client/index-browser')

### 2026-01-29 — Add server-only to quotes repo
- Added the server-only import to the Quotes repo module.
- Re-ran build; failure persists due to missing Prisma client browser artifacts in this environment.

Tests run:
- `npm run build` (failed: Module not found: Can't resolve '.prisma/client/index-browser')

### 2026-01-29 — Quotes API routes use quotes repo
- Created src/modules/quotes/quotes.repo.ts and moved Quotes API Prisma queries into repo functions.
- Updated Quotes API routes to use the repo, keeping runtime behavior the same while enforcing Prisma boundaries.
- Build failed in this environment due to missing Prisma client build artifacts (see tests).

Tests run:
- `npm run build` (failed: Module not found: Can't resolve '.prisma/client/index-browser')

### 2026-01-30 — Orders API routes layered via repo/service
- Moved all Orders API route Prisma access into src/modules/orders/orders.repo.ts and added service wrappers for each Orders route.
- Updated Orders API routes to call orders.service.ts for data access and business rules, keeping routes thin.
- Orders routes no longer import Prisma directly, enforcing the Orders module boundary.

Next steps (immediate)
- Continue module extraction for the next domain (Quotes) following the Orders repo/service pattern.

### 2026-01-29 — Orders module extraction (repo/service/schema/types)
- Moved Orders domain helpers out of src/lib into src/modules/orders (repo/service/schema/types).
- Updated Orders-related API routes and UI imports to use the new module entry points.
- Documented remaining boundary gap: Orders API routes still use Prisma directly and need repo/service extraction later.

Next steps (immediate)
- Move Prisma access from Orders API routes into src/modules/orders/orders.repo.ts with service wrappers.
- Continue module extraction for the next domain (Quotes) after Orders routes are fully layered.

### 2026-01-28 — Architecture map + continuity docs alignment
- Reviewed current app shell, domains, data flow, and charge model to establish a repo-backed architecture map.
- Documented boundary violations and a plan-only Orders module extraction list (no code changes).
- Added docs/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md and created docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md and docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md (docs were missing in /docs).

Next steps (immediate)
- Decide whether to deprecate/remove root AGENT_CONTEXT.md and AGENTS_HANDOFF.md now that docs/ copies exist.
- Begin Orders module extraction planning with repo/service/schema split.

### 2026-01-28 — Continuity spine created + corrected charge note
- Added AGENTS.md (agent charter + architecture rules)
- Added docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md (priorities + invariants + decision log)
- Added docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md (handoff template)
- Clarified that LABOR/ADDON are already per‑part; only other charge kinds may be order‑level

Next steps (immediate)
- Confirm desired UX direction for Orders page (hierarchy, what fields matter)
- Decide initial module split: Orders / Quotes / Customers / Time
- Begin “architecture lock” (file moves + boundary enforcement) without changing functionality

## Upcoming Work Queue (short list)

- [ ] Create src/modules/* structure and migrate one domain (Orders) first
- [ ] Standardize server-side data access pattern (repo/service)
- [ ] Standardize validation entry points (zod schemas in module)
- [ ] Establish mobile-first app shell nav pattern and apply across key pages
- [ ] Implement time tracking model (TimeEntry, active timer constraints)
